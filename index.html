                        <h2>WHY YOU NEED A WEBSITE</h2>
                        <p>This is generally the best way to market your business or enterprise.
                           A website will offer a better return on investment compared to other forms of advertising.
                           The website will earn your business credibility by providing relevant information to 
                           potential customers who browse the internet on a daily basis. Besides gaining new customers 
                           it's easier to keep hold of your old customers by keeping them informed. I mean it would be
                           rather worthless to gain twenty new customers today and lose ten tomorrow, that's not the whole 
                           point of business now, is it? For exmple, here at swiftec, we're using this wonderful website 
                           advertise out web development services and you are our potential customer. We're proud to have you.
